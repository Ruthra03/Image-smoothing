# Image-smoothing

Smoothing, also known as blurring, is a technique in image processing used to reduce noise and detail in an image. It works by averaging the pixel values within a local neighborhood to produce a smoother appearance. This can help in removing unwanted artifacts, making images appear less noisy, and facilitating further image analysis.
